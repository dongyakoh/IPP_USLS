"1. Gross domestic income deflated by the implicit price deflator for gross domestic product."
"2. The arithmetic average of gross domestic product and of gross domestic income, deflated by the implicit price deflator for GDP."
"3. Gross national income deflated by the implicit price deflator for gross national product."
"4. Net domestic income deflated by the implicit price deflator for net domestic product."
"Note. Except as noted in footnotes 1, 2 and 3, chained (2012) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2012 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive."
