"Legend / Footnotes:"
"1. Beginning with 1991, includes change in farm materials and supplies inventories."
"2. Beginning with 1982, this series is derived from the Census Bureau series 'current cost inventories.' For earlier periods, it is derived from the Census Bureau 'book value inventories' series. The series differ in the treatment of inventories reported on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis: The series prior to 1982 is a mix of LIFO and non-LIFO inventories; the series beginning with 1982 is entirely on a non-LIFO basis."
"3. Beginning with 1973, the inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) shown in this table differs from the IVA that adjusts business incomes. The IVA in this table reflects the mix of methods (first-in, first-out; last-in, first-out; etc.) underlying inventories derived primarily from Census Bureau statistics (see footnote 1). This mix differs from that underlying business income derived primarily from Internal Revenue Service statistics. Prior to 1973, the two IVA's are the same because information required for separate estimates is not available."
"4. Prior to 1981, inventories of auto and home supply stores are included in motor vehicle dealers. Beginning with 1981, these inventories are included in 'other durable goods.'"
"Note. Estimates for nonfarm industries other than manufacturing and trade for 1986 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Manufacturing estimates for 1981 and earlier periods and trade estimates for 1966 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 SIC; later estimates for these industries are based on the 1987 SIC. The resulting discontinuities are small."
