"Legend / Footnotes:"
"1. Inventories are as of the end of the quarter. The quarter-to-quarter change in inventories calculated from current-dollar inventories in this table is not the current-dollar change in private inventories component of GDP. The former is the difference between two inventory stocks, each valued at its respective end-of-quarter prices. The latter is the change in the physical volume of inventories valued at average prices of the quarter, whereas, the change in private inventories is stated at annual rates."
"2. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 1990, farm inventories includes materials and supplies inventories."
"3. Prior to the fourth quarter of 1958, inventories held by construction establishments are included in line 5."
"4. Prior to 1981, inventories of auto and home supply stores are included in motor vehicle dealers. Beginning with 1981, these inventories are included in 'other durable goods.'"
"5. Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross output of general government, gross value added of nonprofit institutions, compensation paid to domestic workers, and imputed rental of owner-occupied nonfarm housing. It includes a small amount of final sales by farm and by government enterprises."
"Note. Estimates for nonfarm industries other than manufacturing and trade for 1986 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Manufacturing estimates for 1981 and earlier periods and trade estimates for 1966 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 SIC; later estimates for these industries are based on the 1987 SIC. The resulting discontinuities are small."
