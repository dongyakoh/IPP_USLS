"Legend / Footnotes:"
"1. This series is derived from the Census Bureau series 'current cost inventories.'"
"2. The inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) shown in this table differs from the IVA that adjusts business incomes. The IVA in this table reflects the mix of methods (such as first-in, first-out and last-in, first-out) underlying inventories derived primarily from Census Bureau statistics (see footnote 1).This mix differs from that underlying business income derived primarily from Internal Revenue Service statistics."
"Note. Estimates in this table are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)."
